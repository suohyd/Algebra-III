                Let <m>E/F</m> be a field extension, and let <m>a\in E</m>. Then, <me>

    <proof>
        <p>
            Consider the evaluation <m>F</m>-algebra homomorphism <m>{\mathrm ev}_a\colon F[x]\to E</m> given by <m>p(x)\mapsto p(a)</m>. The image of this homomorphism is a subring of <m>E</m> containing <m>a</m>. By the closure of addition and multiplication the image of <m>{\mathrm ev}_a</m> is contained in every subring of <m>E</m> containing <m>F</m> and <m>a</m>. Thus, the image of <m>{\mathrm ev}_a</m> is the ring generated by <m>a</m>, i.e., <m>F[a]</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A similar argument shows the statement about <m>F(a)</m>.
        </p>
    </proof>
    <remark>
        <p>
            Keep the notations of the above <xref ref="prop-field-generated-by-a-subset"/>. If the kernel of the evaluation homomorphism <m>\ker(\ev_a)\neq (0)</m> (note that <m>\ker(\ev_a)\neq F[x]</m> as ring homomorphisms maps unity to unity and that <m>F[x]</m> is not a zero ring) then, <m>F[x]/\ker(\ev_a)</m> is a field. Therefore, we ge that
            <me>
                F[a]=F(a).
            </me>
            <em>The <m>\ker(\ev_a)</m> is nonzero (resp. zero) if and only if <m>a</m> is a root of some nonzero polynomial in <m>F[x]</m>, i.e., <m>a</m> is algebraic (resp., transcendental) over <m>F</m>.</em>
