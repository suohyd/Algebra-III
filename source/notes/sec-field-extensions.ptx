                        Suppose that <m>\sigma\colon F\to F'</m> is an isomorphism of fields. Let <m>p\in F[x]</m> be an irreducible polynomial and let <m>p'\in F'[x]</m> be a polynomial obtained from <m>p</m> by applying <m>\sigma</m> to coefficients of <m>p</m>. If <m>\alpha</m> (resp., <m>\beta</m>) is a root of <m>p</m> (resp., <m>p'</m>) in some field extension of <m>F</m> (resp., <m>F'</m>), then there is an isomorphism <m>\widetilde{\sigma}\colon F(\alpha)\to F'(\beta)</m> mapping <m>\alpha</m> to <m>\beta</m> and <m>\widetilde{\sigma}|_F=1_F</m>.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    Note that <m>p'</m> is also irreducible. Indeed, <m>\sigma</m> induces an isomorphism of rings <m>F[x]\simeq F'[x]</m> by defining <m>\sum a_ix^i\mapsto\sum\sigma(a_i)x^i</m>. Furthermore, this isomorphism induces an isomorphism of <m>F[x]/(p)\xrightarrow{\sigma_x} F'[x]/(p')</m> given by <m>\sum a_ix^i+(p)\mapsto \sum\sigma(a_i)x^i+(p')</m>. In the following diagram, we can consider the isomorphism <m>\widetilde{\sigma}=\ev_\beta\circ\sigma_x\circ{\ev_\alpha}^{-1}</m>.

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        Suppose that <m>\alpha=\sqrt[3]{2}\in\R</m> and <m>\beta=\omega\alpha\in\C</m>, where <m>\omega</m> is a primitive cube root of unity. Suppose that <m>K=\Q(\alpha)</m> and that <m>L=K(\beta)</m>. We show that <m>[L:\Q]=6</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all note that <m>\beta\not\in\R</m> and hence <m>\beta\not\in K</m>. Furthermore, <m>x^3-2</m> is the minimal polynomial of <m>\alpha</m> over <m>\Q</m> and hence <m>[K:\Q]=3</m>, and <m>\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2\}</m> is a <m>\Q</m> basis of <m>K</m>. The minimal polynomial of <m>\beta</m> over <m>K</m> is <m>x^2+\alpha x+\alpha^2</m>, which is irreducible over <m>K</m> since it has no roots in <m>K</m>. Therefore, <m>[L:K]=2</m>, and <m>\{1,\beta\}</m> is a <m>K</m> basis of <m>L</m>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We claim that <m>\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\beta,\alpha\beta,\alpha^2\beta\}</m> is a <m>\Q</m> basis of <m>L</m>. Let <m>x\in L</m>. There exists a unique <m>a_0,a_1\in K</m> such that <m>x=a_0+a_1\beta</m>. Furthermore, there exists a unique <m>b_{0i}</m> and <m>b_{1i}</m>, for <m>0\leq i\leq 2</m> such that <m>a_0=\sum_{i=0}^2b_{0i}\alpha^i</m> and <m>a_1=\sum_{i=0}^2b_{1i}\alpha^i</m>. In particular, we can write <m>x=\sum_{i=0}^2b_{0i}\alpha^i+\sum_{i=0}^2b_{1i}\alpha^i\beta</m>. This shows that <m>x</m> can be expressed as a linear combination of the elements in <m>\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2,\beta,\alpha\beta,\alpha^2\beta\}</m>. Hence, this set spans <m>L</m> over <m>\Q</m>. To show that it is linearly independent, suppose that there are <m>c_0,c_1,c_2,d_0,d_1,d_2\in\Q</m> such that <me>\sum_{i=0}^2 c_i\alpha^i+\sum_{i=0}^2d_i\alpha^i\beta=0.</me> As <m>\{1,\beta\}</m> is a basis of <m>L</m> over <m>K</m>, we get that 
                        <me>
                            \sum_{i=0}^2 c_i\alpha^i=0\in K\quad\text{ and }\quad\sum_{i=0}^2d_i\alpha^i=0\in K.
                        </me>
                        Using the fact that <m>\{1,\alpha,\alpha^2\}</m> is a basis of <m>K</m> over <m>\Q</m>, we get that <m>c_i=0</m> and <m>d_i=0</m> for all <m>i</m>. This shows that <m>[L:\Q]=6</m>.

                    <p>
                        Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>\overline{F}</m> be an algebraic closure of <m>F</m>. If <m>K/F</m> is an algebraic field extension, then there exists an embedding <m>K\hookrightarrow\overline{F}</m> which is the identity on <m>F</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </proposition>
            <proof>
                <p>
                    Let <m>S=\{(E,i_E):F\subseteq E\subseteq K\text{ and }i_E\colon E\hookrightarrow\overline{F}\text{ which is identity on }F\}</m>. This is a nonempty set as <m>(F,i_F)\in S</m>, where <m>i_F\colon F\hookrightarrow\overline{F}</m> is the inclusion map. We define a partial order on <m>S</m> by setting <m>(E,i_E)\leq (E',i_{E'})</m> if <m>E\subseteq E'</m> and <m>i_{E'}|_E=i_E</m>. Suppose that <m>(E_i,i_{E_i})_{i\in I}</m> is a chain in <m>S</m>. Then, <m>E=\cup E_i</m> is a field and we define <m>i_E(x)=i_{E_k}(x)</m> if <m>x\in E_k</m>. One may verify that <m>i_E</m> is a well-defined embedding which is identity on <m>F</m>. So, we can apply Zorn's lemma to get a maximal element <m>(M,i_M)\in S</m>. We claim that <m>M=K</m>. Indeed, if <m>x\in K</m> then, <m>x</m> is algebraic over <m>M</m>. Let <m>m_{x,M}</m> be the minimal polynomial of <m>x</m> over <m>M</m>. By using <m>i_M\colon M\hookrightarrow\overline{F}</m>, we may take <m>\overline{F}</m> as an algebraic closure of <m>M</m>. Suppose that <m>\alpha\in\overline{F}</m> is a root of <m>m_{x,M}</m>. Hence, there is an embedding <m>M[t]/(m_{x,M})\hookrightarrow\overline{F}</m> extending <m>i_M</m>. Since, <m>M(x)\simeq M[t]/(m_{x,M})</m>, we get an embedding <m>i_{M(x)}\colon M(x)\hookrightarrow\overline{F}</m>. By the maximality of <m>M</m> we conclude that <m>M(x)=M</m>. As <m>x\in K</m> was arbitrary, we get that <m>M=K</m>.

                        Let <m>F</m> be a field and let <m>\overline{F_1}</m> and <m>\overline{F_2}</m> be two algebraic closures of <m>F</m>. Then, there exists an isomorphism <m>i\colon\overline{F_1}\to\overline{F_2}</m> such that <m>i|_F=\text{id}_F</m>.

            <proof>
                <p>
                    We apply <xref ref="prop-embedding-into-algebraic-closure"/> with <m>K=\overline{F_1}</m>, to get an embedding <m>i\colon\overline{F_1}\hookrightarrow\overline{F_2}</m> which is the identity on <m>F</m>. By the isomorphism theorem <m>i(\overline{F_1})\simeq \overline{F_1}</m>, and hence <m>i(\overline{F_1})</m> is algebraically closed. However, <m>\overline{F_2}/i(\overline{F_1})</m> is an algebraic extension. This shows that <m>i(\overline{F_1})=\overline{F_2}</m>, and hence <m>i\colon\overline{F_1}\to\overline{F_2}</m> is a required isomorphism.
