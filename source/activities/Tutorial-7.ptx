            <p>
                Let <m>X</m> be a nonempty subset of a field <m>K</m>, and let <m>K</m> be generated over a field <m>F</m> by <m>X</m>, i.e., <m>K=F(X)</m>. Show that any automorphism <m>\sigma</m> of <m>K</m> fixing <m>F</m> is uniquely determined by the action <m>\sigma</m> on <m>X</m>.

                Let <m>G\leq\Gal{K}{F}</m> be a subgroup of the Galois group of the extension <m>K/F</m>. Assume that <m>G</m> is generated by <m>\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\ldots,\sigma_n</m>. Show that the subfield <m>E/F</m> is fixed by <m>G</m> if and only if <m>E/F</m> is fixed by <m>\sigma_1,\sigma_2,\ldots,\sigma_n</m>.
